		<p>The time has come once again when Whitchurch High School pupils get to experience the once in a lifetime Design and Technology Work Related Education visit to Florence, Italy.</p>
	<p>Flying from Bristol Airport we landed in Pisa on Wednesday night and were coached to Florence. At least this year, we left Wales in 28+ degree heat so it was not such a big shock to the system as we came off the plane. The pupils appreciated the air conditioning in their en-suite rooms as it was a wonderful 32 degrees when we went to Mercato Centrale for their first Italian dining experience.</p>
	<p>Thursday, we boarded the bus to go to the multimillion pound Hyper car Pagani factory. What an incredible space to manufacture vehicles. Designed to resemble the Italian Piazza this area worked with innovative composite materials such as Titanium Carbon Fibre and all the manufacturing techniques Pagani founded to ensure a perfect finish. Pupils were astonished at the sight of people assembling these vehicles at a leisurely pace and took their time ensuring every vehicle had the due care and attention each product needed. Later we were guided around the museum to see some of the rarest and highly valuable vehicles in automotive history. Showing the engineering and design feats that influenced a whole generation of products and vehicles! What an incredible place and one that really is a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p>
	<p>After the eye popping Pagani Factory, we were off to Modena for one of the highlights of the tour, the Ferrari Museum! A breath-taking venue displaying all the heritage of these awe-inspiring machines. The guided tour was very informative and we couldn't believe that we got to see some of the greatest racing cars of the past century. It was a celebration of the marques 70th anniversary so they had really pulled out all the stops to show off their innovation over the years. The museum was absolutely packed full of some of the worlds most jaw dropping vehicles. This place was a fantastic opportunity for the pupils to see how the innovations of the racing track filtered into the everyday that we see in vehicles at home. A truly inspiring place to get students thinking about career paths and the success of manufacturing. </p>
	<p>Wednesday evening was based in Florence and for food we went to the Mercato Centrale. Just walking into this open, modern space you can't help but be impressed. Everything was shiny, bright and new with all sorts of stands featuring Italy's favorites: Mozzarella di Bufala, Pizza, Gelato & Ciocolato, Vegetarian stand where you can get freshly squeezed juice and vegetable soup puree, fresh seafood, fresh pasta, bread and yes even burgers. Suffice to say, a place for everyone to enjoy the culinary delights of Italia. </p>
	<p>Friday was an Italian 'Super' day as we boarded our coach to be transported to the home of Super-Bikes; Bologna. This was an amazing experience as we started with the high tech factory. Our very knowledgeable tour guide took us around the factory floor and showed us how Ducati bikes are manufactured. The process is incredibly well organised and reliable even if it is mostly manufactured by hand! Then to their museum, it was fascinating to see the evolution of these super-bikes, ranging from 1950 to the present day and how their engineers have developed technology to help Ducati be one of the greatest bikes in the world. </p>
	<p>After Ducati we went back to Florence to walk through the beautiful retreat that is the Boboli Gardens. The world famous sight is the perfect place to enjoy and absorb the architecture of Florence. The Gardens were also a welcome retreat from the heat as the pupils were realising why garden areas are essential in a built up area in Architectural design as it is a place for people to switch off from the everyday. Aspiring Architects have really seen this benefit. What a beautiful place to take it all in. Then off to the optional Ferragamo Museum. This is where the pupils could see some of the most desirable handmade shoes known to woman. It is a wake up to the pupils as it is an industry that we are losing in Britain as people think that it can be left to other countries to make them cheaper. The Industry is disappearing in Britain, but it only takes a simple innovative idea from one of our pupils and we could have a Welsh brand to be proud of! </p>
	<p>That evening we ate together at a local restaurant and had presentations before touring around Florence Central seeing the Piazza della Signoria, Ponte Vecchio, Il Duomo, Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral and many more stunning sights. The pupils were more than happy to enjoy the cultural influences of the live Orchestra playing some phenomenal pieces opposite the Uffizi Gallery. What a day! </p>
	<p>Early morning Saturday, we set off home flying over the Leaning Tower of Pisa and arriving back at school on schedule. The Design and Technology visit: Tour de Florence was a complete success. The pupils learnt so much about manufacturing and the careers available in DT. Without it, you wouldn't have the clothes you wear, the cars you drive, the houses you live in, the phones you use and even the screen that you are reading this off. </p>
	<p>Thank you to all the pupils that took part on the visit; they were a credit to the school. Thank you also to their parents/carers for funding them and thank you to Mr. M Williams, Ms. McLeod, Mr. Canale and Ms. Marriott for organising the visit. A particular thanks goes to our local educational visit organiser Schools into Europe for such a trip, it would not have been so smooth without your personal professional touch! Many Thanks all! As we start to plan 2018's visit, we're sure that it will be just as fantastico as this one! </p>
