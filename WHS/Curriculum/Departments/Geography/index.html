				<p> Geography is the study of our world,  its landscapes, peoples, atmosphere and environments. It is also about  the role we play in all aspects of our world.</p>
                <p> Lessons involve a wide variety of teaching  methods to encourage enjoyment of the subject and to encourage all pupils to  take part in classes.&nbsp; Pupils work together in groups creating arguments  and opinions; ICT is used as much as possible to allow pupils to research their  own interests and to expand their knowledge as well as to allow them to present  material in their own unique ways; Practical work such as fieldtrips and  experiments&nbsp; are used frequently to reinforce the practical nature of the  subject and to boost pupils&rsquo; skills; Pupils are also encouraged to ask  questions themselves to encourage their interest in geography and to allow them  to see the relevance to their everyday lives.</p>
                <p> The teachers in the geography  department expect pupils to work to the best of their ability at all times  whether in class or in their homework&rsquo;s.&nbsp; All work is expected to be on  time and neatly produced as this encourages useful work skills for later in  life.&nbsp; At the same time, pupils can expect the staff to be hard working,  interested and fair at all times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An  ethos of hard work and respect is fostered within the department.                </p>
                <p>Geography will  allow you to acquire a knowledge and understanding of a range of places,  environments and geographical patterns at a range of scales from local to  global.  You will develop a sense of  place and appreciation of the environment, as well as awareness of the ways in  which people and environments interact.</p>
                <p>You will develop  an understanding of global citizenship and appreciate that the study of  geography is dynamic.</p>
                <p>The  subject will enable you to acquire and apply skills and techniques, including  those of map work, fieldwork and information and communication technology, in  order to conduct geographical study and enquiry.  Geography will equip you as well as any  subject can for your future and the challenges that await you.</p>
