				<p>Our department includes a range of subjects, including <strong>GCSE/A level Sociology and Psychology</strong> as well as a number of IVET courses: <strong>Asdan COPE and SWEET.</strong>  We offer the opportunity for students to study all 5 subjects at KS4, as well as sociology and psychology at KS5.  We also oversee the running of the <strong>Duke of Edinburgh Award</strong> at our school.</p>
                <p>Students taking subjects within the department will explore and utilise a range of skills, including literacy, numeracy and independent learning. Our subjects are both demanding and rewarding and would particularly appeal to students who wish to pursue a career working with people.  The subjects allow pupils to have a sense of their own identity, as well as understand the behaviour of others.</p>
                <p>We currently offer the following WJEC/Eduqas qualifications:</p>

                <p><strong>Psychology</strong>is an exciting subject that is continuing to evolve.  It aims to explain the human mind and behaviour, including criminal and abnormal behaviour.  Students will explore issues related to daily life such as stress and attraction, and will be encouraged to consider behaviours from different perspectives.  They will investigate new techniques of studying human behavior, including brain scanning, and will plan and conduct research of their own.  Pupils will explore key debates within psychology, such as the ethics of neuroscience and the influence of nature Vs nurture.</p>
                <p><strong>Sociology</strong> is a subject which encourages independent learning and allows students to gain insight into our forever changing world.  It is the study of human society including social relationships, social interaction, and culture. Areas studied in sociology can range from families, power and control, education, media influence, acquiring culture, inequality and crime.  Students will be encouraged to keep up to date with current affairs and will study our changing society.  The subject will allow learners to explore contemporary debates and issues such as crime in society.                </p>

                <p><strong>New for September 2017 (replacing BTEC Public Services)</strong><br /></p>
                  <strong>BTEC: Teamwork and Personal Development in the Community (QCF)</strong> is a course specifically designed for learners who are looking to work in the community as it aims to develop skills that are valued by employers, for example, communication, cooperation and problem solving.  This is an exciting qualification that allows students to learn skills via hands-on activities and teaches students essential transferable skills that can be utilised across a wide range of career choices.  This qualification is similar to its predecessor: Public Services BTEC in its content but it will be assessed solely through portfolios.  There will be no external examination.</p>
                <p><strong>ASDAN COPE</strong>stands for the <strong>Certificate of Personal Effectiveness</strong> and is a nationally recognized qualification.  The qualification offers imaginative ways of accrediting young people’s activities as well as introducing them to new challenges.  The course comprises of 12 modules, for example, communication, Independent living and Sport and Leisure.  Learners will build a portfolio of evidence as they complete various challenges.  They must demonstrate competence at level 1 or 2 in various skills such as <em>working with others</em> and <em>planning &amp; carrying out a piece of research</em>.  Successful completion of the level 2 qualification will lead to 46 points being achieved, which is the equivalent of a B grade.  There is no external examination.<strong></strong></p>
                <p><strong>BTEC: SWEET (Succeeding with Education, Employment and Training)</strong> is an innovative course which develops pupils’ skills through presentations, group work, planning events and discussions.  Successful completion of this qualification leads to a level 2 award (the equivalent of an A*-C grade).  This qualification is split into a number of sections, which help to prepare learners for challenges that lie ahead within education and employment.   The sections are closely linked to the Welsh Baccalaureate qualification, which all pupils in Wales are required to complete.  There is no external examination. </p>
