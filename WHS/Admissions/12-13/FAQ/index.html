		  <h2>Sixth Form FAQ</h2>
		  <div class="breadcrumb"><a  href="../../">back to Admissions Homepage</a></div>
		  <p><strong>How do I apply for the Sixth Form at Whitchurch High School?</strong></p>
		  <p>If you intend applying to Whitchurch High School’s Sixth form, complete an online application form by the deadline set. The application form can be viewed and completed by using the link below:
			 <a href="https://whitchurchhighschool.applicaa.com/sixthform">https://whitchurchhighschool.applicaa.com/sixthform</a>.</p>
			<p>You will be issued with a username and password to allow you to complete your application on-line.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Where do I find a copy of the Sixth Form application form and admission requirements/student contract?</strong></p>
			<p>All the information needed can be found on the school’s website under the admissions tab. Admission requirements, student contract and also these FAQ’s are available to download.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>How do I know if I have been offered a place at Whitchurch High School?</strong></p>
			<p>If you are an internal candidate, you will automatically receive a conditional offer unless informed otherwise. This means that if you secure the minimum entry requirements you will be accepted into the 6th form unless contact has been made to explain why you have not been offered a place. If you are a successful external candidate, you will receive a letter following interview confirming that you been offered a place subject to achieving the required grades. Places on courses will be determined by the criteria listed on page 1 of the entry requirements document.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>What do I do if I have met the entry requirements for the Sixth Form, but do not have the minimum entry requirement for some of the subjects I wish to follow?</strong></p>
			<p>You may still be accepted onto a course with a C grade, even if the entry requirement is a B grade. In this instance decisions on your suitability will be made by departmental staff based on prior performance, aptitude and work ethic. If you are an external candidate your school will be contacted to help us to determine suitability. Places will be allocated according to the criteria listed on page 1 of the admission requirements document.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>How many courses should I study?</strong></p>
			<p>The following learning pathways are for advice only, but may help with your decision:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>7 or more GCSEs at grade C and above with 5 or more at grade B or better to do 4 AS/A2 subjects.</li>
				<li>6 or more GCSEs at grade C and above with 4 at grade B or better to do 3 AS/A2 subjects.</li>
				<li>6 or more GCSEs at grade C and above with 2 at grade B or better to do 1 or 2 AS/A2 subjects plus BTEC/Level 3 equivalent subjects.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p><strong>What do I do if I would like to join the rugby academy?</strong></p>
			<p>Indicate your wish to be considered for the rugby academy at Whitchurch High School by filling in rugby academy where indicated on the option grid on the online Sixth Form application form. It would also be useful for you to include a short statement highlighting your rugby playing experience to date when asked about your hobbies and interests. </p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>How can I find out more information about the rugby academy?</strong></p>
			<p>More information is available by <a href="../../../Students/RugbyAcademy/">clicking here</a>. Alternatively, contact the school on 02920629700 and ask to speak to Steve Williams</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Do I have to attend assemblies/tutor periods?</strong></p>
			<p>Yes. All students are required to attend assemblies, organised events and tutor periods / wellbeing sessions as notified. Assemblies / organised events/tutor periods/ wellbeing sessions are an essential means of communication and identify the 6th form as part of the school.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Is there a dress code for sixth form?</strong></p>
			<p>Yes. You are reminded that 6th Form students remain part of an 11-18 school. You are required to exercise discretion in your choice of clothing and avoid extreme fashions that are inappropriate to a school environment. Please see 6th form dress code in the student contract. 6 th form tutors and senior Staff reserve the right to make decisions about the suitability of appearance if difficulties arise. The Head Teacher will act as the final arbiter. This requirement continues to apply throughout the academic years, including all examination periods.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Will I have to sign a contract?</strong></p>
			<p>Yes. The compulsory student contract must be read and agreed when an application to sixth form is started as it sets out the expectations Whitchurch High School has for all students in sixth form. A copy of the contract is kept on file and will be referred to if necessary. Any student who is unable to co-operate with the expectations listed needs to be aware that it may be reflected in any reference the school may write. Formal warning and notification will be given to students and parents/carers if any of the expectations are not adhered to.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>What should I do if I am going to be absent?</strong></p>
			<p>Where absence from school and/or lessons is planned, you should notify your subject teachers, Form Tutor and the 6th form pastoral assistant in advance – e.g. medical/dental appointment. If the absence is not planned a telephone call must be made on the first day of absence to the 6th form pastoral assistant on 029 20 629 742. Any student absence should be accompanied by a letter from a parent or carer or a medical certificate, which should be given to the appropriate form tutor or the 6th form pastoral assistant on the first day back after the absence. If your attendance gives cause for concern, communication will be made with you and your parents/carers and a meeting will be set up to discuss these concerns.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Can I change course (discontinuing one course and commencing another)?</strong></p>
			<p>Only following discussion with senior staff and completion of a change of course form prior to the end of September. The change of course form requires approval from department leaders of the subjects concerned. It must also be countersigned by a parent / carer. Until final approval for the change is given, you must continue to attend lessons for which you are enrolled.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Can I reduce the number of AS or A2 courses that I am studying?</strong></p>
			<p>It is important that you make informed decisions. Any amendment to your course of study may only be made following discussion with Head of Sixth Form, subject teacher, department leader and satisfactory approval from a parent / carer. A change of options form will then need to be completed and countersigned by all parties.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Would I be allowed to resit Year 12? Would I be allowed to resit Year 13?</strong></p>
			<p>No. We are an 11-18 school and you will need to remain within your age appropriate year group. You are able to re-sit components of AS during Year 13 alongside your A2 studies. Please refer to the admissions requirements document for information about appeals and extenuating circumstances.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Who pays for examination entries and fees?</strong></p>
			<p><b>Entry for AS/A2 courses</b></p>
			<p>Students who are enrolled for a course will be entered for the appropriate examinations as long as the department recommends entry.</p>
			<p><b>Examination fees for recommended entries will be paid for by the School except:</b></p>
			<p>a) Where a student chooses to withdraw from the examination on or after the date when a late amendment incurs a financial penalty.</p>
			<p>b) Where a student fails to sit all or part of the examination (including a coursework component) for a reason other than illness that is accompanied by medical certification.</p>
			<p><i>In circumstances a) and b) above the cost of examination entry shall be at the student’s expense.</i></p>
			<p>c) Where a student’s attendance falls below 90% (unless absence is authorised).</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Entry for re-sits of GCSE/AS/A2 units</b></p>
			<p>Will be at the student’s expense.</p>
			<p>A department may withhold recommendation for entry if there are significant concerns about the student’s: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Attendance</li>
				<li>Submission of work to the required standard</li>
				<li>Validity of the student’s own work</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Parents/Carers will be notified of any such concerns.</p>
			<p>Students attending Whitchurch High but following a subject elsewhere may be asked tomeet their course fees and the cost of the examination for that subject</p>
